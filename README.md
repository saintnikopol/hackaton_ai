# Lancaster

We are Team Lancaster. Our startup aims to help people that want to improve their language speaking skills (e.g.: English). We provide a virtual English Professor that will participate in day-to-day activities or join certain on-line meetings and will help the user speak better. For example when the user joins a Zoom meeting he/she will see a real-time live-feed with his/her transcription and eventual corrections. At the end he/she will get a summary in a video-format made by Miss Lancaster of the mistakes done at the time of the conversation plus general feedback

Future ideas: improvement our virtual English Teacher and make it work for real-life scenarios like for example using AI-enabled wearable or VR glasses.
